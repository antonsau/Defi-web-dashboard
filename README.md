# DeFi dashboard
### Intro
This is a web-view of the team's dashboard. We are tracking projects just in the [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ULbWNxrPQIKqROIgfH4MkirQzH0HrZnOvc28aepjaz0/edit#gid=458547349). However, we'd like to introduce some simple web view for our audience. This is the result.

### Algorithm
Users can refresh data by clicking the Refresh button. The app will upload data from the spreadsheet to Django model. Then data is presented across views.
