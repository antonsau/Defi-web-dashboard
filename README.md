# DeFi dashboard
### Intro
This is a web-view of the team's dashboard. We are tracking projects just in the spreadsheet. However, we'd like to introduce some simple web view for our audience. This is the result.

### Algorithm
Users can refresh data by clicking the Refresh button. The app will upload data from the spreadsheet to Django model. Then data is presented across views.
